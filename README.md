# üî•üê∂firedog by tinydog

**NOTE:** We are currently building out base modules for this and this project is on hold until we have more of a foundation in place. We do not feel this will take too long. To see the MVC we are building to power this, please view our [https://github.com/tinydogio/veggiedog](veggiedog) project.

_firedog_ intends to be an API generation and management tool similar to [https://parseplatform.org/](Parse) and [https://firebase.google.com/](Firebase). Size and scale are open to discussion at the moment so now's the time to chime up.  :-)

**Ideas**
* Move from [https://expressjs.com/](Express) to [http://restify.com/](restify).
* Move from [https://expressjs.com/](Express) to straight [https://nodejs.org/](Node).
* Make each endpoint act as a microservice that can be individually scaled as needed.
* Move to straight ES6+ instead of [https://www.typescriptlang.org/](TypeScript).
* Dashboard for management.
* Starter templates (CMS, ecommerce, Uber-like, etc).
* Ability to extend via plugins/adapters.
* Sockets.
* [https://www.docker.com/](Docker) & [https://kubernetes.io/](Kubernetes) support.
* Multi language SDK's.
* Third-party integrations.

## Setup

**Dependencies**
* [https://www.docker.com/](Docker)
* [https://nodejs.org/](Node) v8.9.4

Once the dependencies are installed, open the project in a terminal and enter ```npm install```.

## Run Project

From your terminal, enter ```npm run start-docker```.

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser of choice.

## Connecting to mongo running in Docker

Enter the following command in your terminal: ```docker exec -it mongo mongo```.

## Current State

The project is really a foundation right now and will change over time.

Routes are registered by adding to an existing ```./routes/*.router.ts``` file in the corresponding ```register()``` method. If you need a new base route create a new file in the ```./src/routes``` directory ending in ```.router.ts``` and use an existing router as an example for how to implement it. Router files are auto loaded on application start.

**Sample Routes**
* [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - Returns static payload showing the app is running.
* [http://localhost:3000/endpoints](http://localhost:3000/endpoints) - Returns a static list of endpoints (sorted by name).
* [http://localhost:3000/users](http://localhost:3000/users) - Returns a static list of users.
* [http://localhost:3000/users/contains/:name](http://localhost:3000/users/contains/joshua) - Returns boolean if name exists in static array.
