# firedog by tinydog

_firedog_ intends to be an API generation and management tool similar to Parse and Firebase. Size and scale are open to discussion at the moment so now's the time to chime up.  :-)

**Ideas**
* Move from express to restify.
* Move from express to straight node.
* Make each endpoint act as a microservice that can be individually scaled as needed.
* Move to straight ES6 instead of TypeScript.
* Dashboard for management.
* Starter templates (CMS, ecommerce, Uber-like, etc).
* Ability to extend via plugins/adapters.
* Sockets.
* Third-party integrations.
